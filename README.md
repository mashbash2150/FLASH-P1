### **_Description_**

#### 
The objective of FLASH is much like that of the beloved game of Simon.  The player will be presented with a sequence of visual prompts in the form of blinking colors that they will need to repeat by clicking buttons representing each prompt. If the player replicates the sequence correctly, they will advance to the next level, where the sequence of prompts will increase in complexity/variation and speed.  Should the user recreate the sequence incorrectly, the game will be over. 


FLASH will be a test of memory and attention, and will feature fun graphics and a dynamic browser-based game interface.   The simplistic UI and lack of concrete directions was intentional - the layout should be intuitive enough for the user to get started without needing additional guidance.  The design and user experience of games like "Guides" are big influences of mine.
