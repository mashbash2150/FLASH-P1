### **_Description_**

#### 
The objective of (Game name TBD) is much like that of the beloved game of Simon.  Players will be presented with a sequence of various visual prompts 
(this will be elaborated on as I flesh the game out), that they will need to repeat with buttons representing each prompt.  If the player replicates the sequence correctly, they will
move on to the next level, where the sequence of prompts will increase in complexity/variation and speed.  Should the user recreates the sequence incorrectly, the game will be over.  
(Insert game name) will be a test of memory and attention, and will feature fun graphics and a dynamic browser-based game interface.
